# Each command supports two interfaces, one for
# command line and one for Ncurses.
# You may need to overwrite the class methods for convenience.
# Each command may need to contemplate how the result is
# going to be output, options could be:
#
#   STDOUT in plain/formated text.
#   STDOUT in structured format like JSON.
#   Object or hash returned by the run() method.
